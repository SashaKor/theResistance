## OUR PROJECT:

This is a role-playing, text-based game that plays off of social classes in high school. Each player is a "type" of person (a part of a social class). They will complete tasks and simulate the actions of the type of person they are. The player is judged by how well they are at becoming the type they have been selected to be.

## Instructions:
 
The user starts out with taking a multiple-choice quiz that will determine with social class they belong to. After they are put into a social class, they will simulate everyday scenes of a high-schooler (such as studying, partying, etc.). However, the player must select the choices that match their social class, or ele they will lose points. If any aspect of the player's life is too low (such as friends, mental health, etc), they will lose. Players have the ability to bring up their points through mini-games and choosing choices that match what they would do if they were a part of the social class in real life. Once the player has gone through a week of high school, the game will end and they will see how they did in all aspects of their lives, along with a general score.
